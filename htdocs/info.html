            <p> Routes is a parallelized evolutionary algorithm built for computing hyperloop routes. We utilize the an algorithm called Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strateies, or CMA-ES. We strove to create a near real time platform for computing hyperloop routes. Given two locations in the United States, Routes will calculate the 
            'best' route to get from point A to point B. It will also display useful statistics related to the computed route such as the estimated time to traverse this route and the length of the track.</p>

            <h2>
                <div class="grad-text">Why</div> Build Routes?
            </h2>
            
            <p>The computation of a hyperloop route is a high dimensional optimization problem, which makes it difficult for engineers and planners to propose building one. There are four main considerations when building a hyperloop route.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>The curvature of the tube must be taking into consideration, since making turns would require the hyperloop pod to decrease its speed.</li>
                <li>The changes in elevation, or the grade of the track is also an important consideration; if the route has too high of a grade, the pod risks crashing into the track.</li>
                <li>The route would like to avoid mountains, or any other kind of terrain that would require tunneling, as tunneling would drive up costs. The tradeoffs between curvature, the grade of the track, and the cost of tunneling are what make this problem so complex.</li>
                <li>The final consideration is the length of the route of the route, as longer routes would both cost more money to build, and would also increase the efficiency of traveling along the route.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>The goal when building Routes was to design an algorithm that can efficiently compute the best potential Hyperloop Route between two give locations based on these considerations. This tool could be used both to help estimate the cost of building a Hyperloop track, as well a showcase of the merits of Hyperloop to everyone. Virgin Hyperloop One has already built a tool that allows consumers to compare estimated times of travel for a hyperloop track. However, they calculate this estimation by assuming a straight line distance between the two locations, completely ignoring all of the before mentioned constraints or the time needed to accelerate at the beginning and end of the route.. </p>
            
            <p>We believe that Routes improves on this estimation by taking into account the above considerations, as well as providing a visual for what the route would look like. In doing so, we hope that this brings us one step closer to having a Hyperloop built.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>In order to make our algorithm consider all of the necessary constraints, it needs to take data about the world around the route. To do so we use the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), which allows us to take data from the USGS and interpret it in a meaningful way.</li>
                        <li>CMA-ES is highly parallelizable, allowing us to utilize a GPU to speed up computation by orders of magnitude. In order to leverage the GPU, we use the OpenCL library.</li>
                        <li>We also make use of the following libraries: 
                            <ol>
                                <li>Boost</li>
                                <li>OpenGL Mathematics</li>
                                <li>Eigen</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>In order to reduce the number of computations, we have chosen to use Bézier curves to represent a route. Bézier curves use a fixed number of 'control points' to represent a larger line.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                        CMA-ES
                    </h3>
                    
                    <p>Since our problem is ill-conditioned and has a high dimensionality, we decided to use an evolutionary algorithm. We chose CMA-ES for a few reasons. First, it has a very large search space, so it avoids getting stuck on local optimam, and second, CMA-ES has two evolution paths, an isotropic and anisotropic path, which prevents the solution from converging prematurely. CMA-ES has four main steps:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Generate a series of completely random candidate solutions. These are guaranteed to start at a desired position and end at a desired position.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each candidate solution is evaluated. In this step the curvature, pylon cost, tunneling cost, and route length are considered. The fitness function weighs these four considerations and outputs a numerical score for the candidate. This function is what CMA-ES is attempting to minimize.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After each candidate is evaluated, the best performing candidates are used to adjust the random distribution that candidates are sampled from. This increases the likelihood that succesive generations' candidates will be closer to the absolute minimum of the fitness function.
                        </li>
                        <li>A new random collection of candidates is generated based on this updated distribution and steps two through four are repeated for the desired number of times.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Using the isotropic and anisoptropic evolution paths, as well as step size control, we can ensure that the algorithm explores the entire space of possible solutions.</p>
